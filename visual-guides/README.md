| Guide | Purpose | Use When |
|-------|---------|----------|
| [Memory Leak Flowchart](./memory-leak-flowchart.md) | Identify leak type | You don't know what kind of leak you have |
| [Detection Decision Tree](./detection-decision-tree.md) | Step-by-step diagnosis | You need detailed debugging steps |
| [Fix Strategies Matrix](./fix-strategies-matrix.md) | Fix patterns by type | You know the leak type, need the fix |

## Quick Start

1. **Unknown leak?** Start with [Memory Leak Flowchart](./memory-leak-flowchart.md)
2. **Production issue?** Use [Detection Decision Tree](./detection-decision-tree.md)
3. **Know the type?** Jump to [Fix Strategies Matrix](./fix-strategies-matrix.md)
